<p>In this Guided Project on <a href='http://dataquest.io'>Dataquest</a> I'll work analyzing gun deaths in the US. The dataset came from <a href='https://fivethirtyeight.com/'>FiveThirtyEight</a> and can be found <a href='https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data'>here</a>. The dataset is stored in the <code>guns.csv</code>. It contains information on guns deaths in the US from 2012 to 2014. Each row in the dataset represents a single fatality. The columns contain demographic and other information about the victim.<p>
